<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Matthew Arnold, explaining why those were his most popular poems
which dealt with his canine pets, Geist, Kaiser, and Max, said
that while comparatively few loved poetry, nearly everyone loved
dogs.</p>

<p>The literature of the Anglo-Saxon is rich in tributes to the
dog, as becomes a race which beyond any other has understood and
developed its four-footed companions. Canine heroes whose
intelligence and faithfulness our prose writers have celebrated
start to the memory in scores&mdash;Bill Sykes's white shadow, which
refused to be separated from its master even by death; Rab,
savagely devoted; the immortal Bob, "son of battle"&mdash;true souls
all, with hardly a villain among them for artistic contrast.
Even Red Wull, the killer, we admire for his courage and lealty.</p>

<p>Within these covers is a selection from a large body of dog
verse. It is a selection made on the principle of human appeal.
Dialect, and the poems of the earlier writers whose diction
strikes oddly on our modern ears, have for the most part been
omitted. The place of such classics as may be missed is filled
by that vagrant verse which is often most truly the flower of
inspiration.</p>

health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where
the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he

food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in
encounter with the roughness of the world. When all other

reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the

<span class="i0">The record written of Salah-ud-Deen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Sultan&mdash;how he met, upon a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his own city on the public way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman whom they led to die? The veil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was stripped from off her weeping face, and pale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her shamed cheeks were, and wild her fixed eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her lips drawn with terror at the cry<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Borne in their hands to break her flesh and bones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the law stood that sinners such as she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perish by stoning, and this doom must be;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Glaring upon the water out of reach,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The long silk of her girdle, made a cup<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the heel's hollow, and thus let it sink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until it touched the cool black water's brink;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So filled th' embroidered shoe, and gave a draught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the spent beast, which whined, and fawned, and quaffed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her kind gift to the dregs; next licked her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such glad looks that all might understand<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span><span class="i0">The veil once more about the sinner's face,<br /></span>

<h3>THE MISER'S ONLY FRIEND</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There watched a cur before the miser's gate&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A very cur, whom all men seemed to hate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaunt, shaggy, savage, with an eye that shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a live coal; and he possessed but one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bark was wild and eager, and became<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That meager body and that eye of flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His master prized him much, and Fang his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His master fed him largely, but not that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor aught of kindness made the snarler fat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flesh he devoured, but not a bit would stay&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He barked, and snarled, and growled it all away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ribs were seen extended like a rack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And coarse red hair hung roughly o'er his back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lamed in one leg, and bruised in wars of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now his sore body made his temper sore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such was the friend of him who could not find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor make him one, 'mong creatures of his kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brave deeds of Fang his master often told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The son of Fury, famed in deeds of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Snatch and Rabid sprung; and noted they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In earlier times&mdash;each dog will have his day.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The notes of Fang were to his master known<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For both conveyed, to the experienced ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I snarl and bite because I hate and fear."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None passed ungreeted by the master's door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fang railed at all, but chiefly at the poor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the nights were stormy, cold and dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The act of Fang was a perpetual bark.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But though the master loved the growl of Fang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were who vowed the ugly cur to hang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose angry master, watchful for his friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As strongly vowed his servant to defend.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In one dark night, and such as Fang before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was ever known its tempests to outroar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his protector's wonder now expressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No angry notes&mdash;his anger was at rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wond'ring master sought the silent yard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left Phoebe sleeping, and his door unbarred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor more returned to that forsaken bed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lo! the morning came, and he was dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fang and his master side by side were laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In grim repose&mdash;their debt to nature paid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The master's hand upon the cur's cold chest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was now reclined, and had before been pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if he sought how deep and wide the wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That laid such spirit in a sleep so sound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he found it was the sleep of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sympathizing sorrow stopped his breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close to his trusty servant he was found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As cold his body, and his sleep as sound.<br /></span>

<h3>HORSE, DOG AND MAN</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The horse and the dog had tamed a man and fastened him to a fence:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said the horse to the dog: "For the life of me, I don't see a bit of sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In letting him have the thumbs that grow at the sides of his hands. Do you?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dog looked solemn and shook his head, and said: "I'm a goat if I do!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The poor man groaned and tried to get loose, and sadly he begged them, "Stay!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will rob me of things for which I have use by cutting my thumbs away!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will spoil my looks, you will cause me pain; ah, why would you treat me so?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I am, God made me, and He knows best! Oh, masters, pray let me go!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The dog laughed out, and the horse replied, "Oh, the cutting won't hurt you, see?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll have a hot iron to clap right on, as you did in your docking of me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God gave you your thumbs and all, but still, the Creator, you know, may fail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do the artistic thing, as he did in the furnishing me with a tail."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they bound the man and cut off his thumbs, and were deaf to his pitiful cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they seared the stumps, and they viewed their work through happy and dazzled eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How trim he appears," the horse exclaimed, "since his awkward thumbs are gone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the life of me I cannot see why the Lord ever put them on!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Still it seems to me," the dog replied, "that there's something else to do;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ears look rather too long for me, and how do they look to you?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man cried out: "Oh, spare my ears! God fashioned them as you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if you apply your knife to them, you'll surely disfigure me."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But you didn't disfigure me, you know," the dog decisively said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"When you bound me fast and trimmed my ears down close to the top of my head!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they let him moan and they let him groan while they cropped his ears away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they praised his looks when they let him up, and proud indeed were they.<br /></span>

<h3>FRANCES</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You were a friend, Frances, a friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With feeling and regard and capable of woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, yes, I know you were a dog, but I was just a man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I did not buy you; no, you simply came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lost, and squatted on my doorstep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The place was strange&mdash;you quivered, but stayed on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I had need of you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No other fellow could make you follow him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you had chosen me to be your pal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My whistle was your law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You put your paw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon my palm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in your calm, deep eyes was writ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The promise of long comradeship.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I came home from work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Late and ill-tempered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Always I heard the patter of your feet upon the oaken stairs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your nose was at the door-crack;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whether I'd been bad or good that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You fawned, and loved me just the same.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was your way to understand.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span><span class="i0">And if I struck you, my harsh hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was met with your caresses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You took my leavings, crumb and bone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stuck by me through thick and thin&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You were my kin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then one day you died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And were put deep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But though you sleep, and ever sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sense you at my heels.<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Shepherd.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Be not affrighted, madame. Poor Pierrot<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will do no harm. I know his voice is gruff,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But then, his heart is good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Traveler.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, call him, then.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I do not like his looks. He's growling now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Shepherd.</i> Madame&nbsp;&nbsp;had better drop that stick. Pierrot,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He is as good a Christian as myself<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And does not like a stick.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Traveler.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a fierce look!<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Shepherd</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, bless poor Pierrot's teeth!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Good cause have I and mine to bless those teeth.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come here, my Pierrot. Would you like to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Madame, what Pierrot's teeth have done for me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Traveler.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torn a gaunt wolf, I'll warrant.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">On that high ledge a cross of wood that stands<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Against the sky?<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Traveler.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just where the cliff goes down<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A hundred fathoms sheer, a wall of rock<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To where the river foams along its bed?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I've often wondered who was brave to plant<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A cross on such an edge.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">That the good God might know I gave him thanks.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One night, it was November, black and thick,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The fog came down, when as I reached my house<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Marie came running out; our little one,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our four year Louis, so she cried, was lost.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I called Pierrot: "Go, seek him, find my boy,"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And off he went. Marie ran crying loud<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To call the neighbors. They and I, we searched<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All that dark night. I called Pierrot in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whistled and called, and listened for his voice;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He always came or barked at my first word,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But now, he answered not. When day at last<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Broke, and the gray fog lifted, there I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On that high ledge, against the dawning light.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My little one asleep, sitting so near<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That edge that as I looked his red barette<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fell from his nodding head down the abyss.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And there, behind him, crouched Pierrot; his teeth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His good, strong teeth, clenching the jacket brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Holding the child in safety. With wild bounds<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Swift as the gray wolf's own I climbed the steep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And as I reached them Pierrot beat his tail,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And looked at me, so utterly distressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With eyes that said: "Forgive, I could not speak,"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But never loosed his hold till my dear rogue<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was safe within my arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Ah, ha, Pierrot,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Madame forgives your barking and your teeth;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I knew she would.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Traveler.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come here, Pierrot, good dog,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come here, poor fellow, faithful friend and true,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come, come, be friends with me.<br /></span>

<h3>ROVER IN CHURCH</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas a Sunday morning in early May,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beautiful, sunny, quiet day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the village, old and young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had trooped to church when the church bell rung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The windows were open, and breezes sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fluttered the hymn books from seat to seat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even the birds in the pale-leaved birch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang as softly as if in church!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Right in the midst of the minister's prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came a knock at the door. "Who's there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wonder?" the gray-haired sexton thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As his careful ear the tapping caught.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rap-rap, rap-rap&mdash;a louder sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boys on the back seats turned around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What could it mean? for never before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had any one knocked at the old church door.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Again the tapping, and now so loud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The minister paused (though his head was bowed).<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rappety-rap! This will never do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The girls are peeping, and laughing too!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the sexton tripped o'er the creaking floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted the latch and opened the door.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In there trotted a big black dog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As big as a bear! With a solemn jog<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right up the centre aisle he pattered;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">People might stare, it little mattered.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight he went to a little maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who blushed and hid, as though afraid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there sat down, as if to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I'm sorry that I was late today,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But better late than never, you know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside, I waited an hour or so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And couldn't get them to open the door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I wagged my tail and bumped the floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now little mistress, I'm going to stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hear what the minister has to say."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The poor little girl hid her face and cried!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the big dog nestled close to her side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed her, dog fashion, tenderly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wondering what the matter could be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dog being large (and the sexton small),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sat through the sermon, and heard it all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As solemn and wise as any one there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a very dignified, scholarly air!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And instead of scolding, the minister said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he laid his hand on the sweet child's head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the service, "I never knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two better list'ners than Rover and you!"<br /></span>

<h3>CANINE IMMORTALITY</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And they have drowned thee then at last! poor Phillis!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The burden of old age was heavy on thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet thou shouldst have lived! What though thine eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was dim, and watched no more with eager joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wonted call that on thy dull sense sunk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fruitless repetition, the warm sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might still have cheered thy slumber; thou didst love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lick the hand that fed thee, and though past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Youth's active season, even life itself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was comfort. Poor old friend! How earnestly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would I have pleaded for thee! thou hadst been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still the companion of my childish sports:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as I roamed o'er Avon's woody cliffs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From many a day-dream has thy short quick bark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recalled my wandering soul. I have beguiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Often the melancholy hours at school,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soured by some little tyrant, with the thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of distant home, and I remembered then<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span><span class="i0">Thy faithful fondness: for not mean the joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returning at the pleasant holidays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt from thy dumb welcome. Pensively<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes have I remarked the slow decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeling myself changed, too, and musing much,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On many a sad vicissitude of life!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, poor companion! when thou followedst last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy master's parting footsteps to the gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which closed forever on him, thou didst lose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy truest friend, and none was left to plead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the old age of brute fidelity!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fare thee well! Mine is no narrow creed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And He who gave thee being did not frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mystery of life to be the sport<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of merciless man! There is another world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all that live and move&mdash;a better one!<br /></span>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
